# Election Analysis
![mod3.png](Resources/mod3.png)


## Overview 

For this project, the task entailed tabulating and auditing results of a local congressional election. There were three candidates: Diana DeGette; Charles Casper Stockham; Raymon Anthony Doane. The data regarding the election, votes, and candidates was provided in a CSV file. The following was performed to complete the analysis:

- Calculate the number of votes casted
- List the candidates who received the votes
- Determine the percentage of the candidate's votes
- Retrieve vote count of the candidates
- Determine the winner of election based on popular vote
- Analyze votes by county


## Results

- There were 369,711 casted votes
- DeGette received 73.8% of the votes casted (total of 272,892 votes)
- Stockham received 23% of the votes casted (total of 85,213 votes)
- Doane received 3.1% of the votes (total of 11,606 votes)
- Denver had the largest county turnout (306,055 / 82.8% of casted votes)

The winner of Colorado's congressional election, based on popular vote, was Diane DeGette. Her decisive victory showed she was the strongest candidate in this race. Charles Casper Stockham finished at distanced second place, and Raymon Anthony Doane finished last.

Denver, Jefferson, and Arapahoe counties were also analyzed for this analysis. It included county votes, the percentages of voters, and the largest county turnout. Denver had the strongest voter turnout, followed by disappointing results in Jefferson and Arapahoe.

## Resources

During this assignment, the power of Python was used to automate the vote-counting process for the election. The knowledge of variables, arrays, conditionals, and loops was applied for the following:

- Create scripts that read, write, and store data from files or in arrays
- Perform mathematical operations
- Use decision statements, logical operations for complex comparisons, and repetition statements to run code more than once
- Produce screen outputs

Visual Studio Code (VS Code), another powerful tool, was configured to use the Python environment installed. VS Code provides helpful integration features that can be used for working with different environments.

 Having these two programs working in conjunction to analyze the data made the workflow faster and increased productivity. The Python version required for this project was 3.7.6, but version 3.8.5 was a better choice for security reasons. The version of VS Code used was 2.3.0. 


## Summary

This script was tested for errors during the coding process. The detailed script may be used as a template for future district elections. In addition, the script may be used for other purposes as well (e.g., school districts, state-wide elections). The script is user friendly, easy to follow, and interpret. 


## Recommendation

More needs to be done to entice residents from Jefferson and Arapahoe counties to vote. A resident survey should be conducted and then analyzed using similar codes to the one used for this assignment, in order to find why these counties had a poor turnout.
