# Election_Analysis

## Project Overview

For this project, we were given a task to assist Tom, a Board of Elections employee, tabulate and audit the results of an election. During this assignment, we were introduced to Python; the most widely used programming language and a very powerful tool. Python efficiently enabled the process of writing algorithms to confirm and analyze the election results. This programming language has risen in popularity due to its simple structure, it is easy to read and maintain, and has a broad standard library.

Python was not the only tool used to execute the scripts. In order to edit and save the code as it was being written, we use another great tool: Visual Studio Code.
This free text editor is the most popular developer tool. It is also widely used by millions of programmers aroung the world. Having these two programs working in conjuction to analyze the data made the workflow faster, and increased productivity. The task that were required through the use of Python and VS Code were the following:
- Calculating the total number votes
- Total of votes that candidates received
- Percentage of the votes that the candidates received
- Winner based on popular vote

## Resources

The data provided to perform this analysis was a CSV file, which could quickly be converted to an Excel or Numbers file. The python version required was 3.7.6, but version 3.8.5 was a better choice for security reasons. The version of VS Code used was 2.3.0. 

## Summary

The analysis of the data from the election showed the following:
